Create apps: 
client: authenticate, booking, outlook, profile 
owner: authenticate, availability

All templates are abble to display messages, now the messages have to be provided by the views in the appointment app

Register should be able to login in some cases

message tags should appear with different colour

Every time a Brecha is created it creates gaps in its range with a foreignkey field related to it, 
if the Brecha is modified it first deletes all its gaps and then creates new ones, if there is overlapping 
among Brechas the page will breack down and raise and error thus it must be fixed, besides it would be good
to keep the already existing gaps

new order to schedule an appointment: select service, select date, select time, it seems to work just fine,
also added some messages and all new translations 

Planing to merge schedule into main to them push up to heroku, however there will be some trouble with 
the database most likely, just when I had to delete the db and so on to integrate the new changes in the models.
