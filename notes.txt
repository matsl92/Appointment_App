Every time a Brecha is created it creates gaps in its range with a foreignkey field related to it, 
if the Brecha is modified it first deletes all its gaps and then creates new ones, if there is overlapping 
among Brechas the page will breack down and raise and error thus it must be fixed, besides it would be good
to keep the already existing gaps
